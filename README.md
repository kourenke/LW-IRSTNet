To verify the accuracy, robustness, and computational complexity of LW-IRSTNet, 17 state-of-the-art networks are used as baselines for comparative analysis. The experimental results showed that the segmentation accuracy indexes (mIOU, F1, ROC) of LW-IRSTNet are all above or equal to the baseline best results on the five public datasets. Meanwhile, the network params are compressed to 0.16M and FLOPs to 303M, which is much lower than the baseline results.

To deploy LW-IRSTNet on different mobile terminals, I uploaded models in different formats, including pkl, onnx, ncnn, tnn, and mnn.
